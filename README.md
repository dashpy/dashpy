### ðŸ‘‹ Hey 

I'm a Computer Engineer with different hats sometimes frontend, sometimes backend, and a occasional Scrum Master. I often write articles on my LinkedIn Profile about different topics. I'm currently working on different projects and taking some time off from work. During the last 3 years (2019-2022) I have been working as a Frontend Engineer in a company based in Amsterdam on multiple projects and now I'm working in a startup from CDMX with Python and React.

### ðŸ¤“ Iâ€™m interested in learning about
- Big data 
- Improvements tools (CI/CD) and advance concepts 
- Scale patterns

### :rocket: I'm open to collaborate with
- Projects private or open sources that face problems to climate change or health issues

###   ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
 - Apollo GraphQL and NPL
